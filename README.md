- [ ] - redo modal for creating measurables (to match how we did the areas dialog)
  - [ ] - make sure modal doesn't overflow and has scrolling
- [ ] - add more color, like: <https://sunshinestateamateur.com>

- [ ] Long term todos
  - [ ] - figure out when to use null vs undefined... running into issues where I have to convert nulls to undefined and I'm not sure which is correct
  - [ ] - save off my ui stuff (custom components)
    - [ ] - see about converting the scrollingContainer into just a container which has a scrolling option
- [ ] - build watch app
  - [ ] - watch app to pop up alerts when things are coming due
  - [ ] - set timer to motivate and nudge me to start doing things and possibly time how long things take (pomodoro)
